# Problem Set 3: Introduction to AR and Image Mosaic

## NOTE: Please refer to the PDF file for instructions. GitHub markdown does not render formulae and algorithms correctly. The information is identical between the markdown and PDF, but the PDF renders more cleanly.

# Assignment Description

## Description
Problem Set 3 introduces basic concepts behind Augmented Reality, using the contents that you will learn in modules 3A-3D and 4A-4C: Projective geometry, Corner detection, Perspective imaging, and Homographies, respectively.
Additionally, you will also learn how to insert images within images and stitch multiple images together.

## Learning Objectives

-  Find markers using corner detection and / or pattern recognition.
-  Learn how projective geometry can be used to transform a sample image from one plane to another.
-  Address the marker recognition problem when there is noise in the scene.
-  Implement backwards (reverse) warping.
-  Implement Harris corner detection to identify correspondence points for an image with multiple views.
-  Address the presence of distortion / noise in an image.
